# React Autocomplete

This is a demo of a React Autocompletion component written with minimal dependencies.

## Running

You'll firstly need an API key from the Marvel developer portal. Ensure that
localhost is set as an authorised referring. Set this inside a `.env.local` file.

Example:
```
REACT_APP_MARVEL_API_KEY="your_key"
```

Then run:
```
npm run start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000.
